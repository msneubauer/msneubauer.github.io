The ATLAS and CMS experiments announced the discovery of a Higgs boson h. This discovery lead to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for its theoretical prediction
* My group contributed to this discovery (5.9&sigma;) [PLB 716 (2012) 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7214) through analysis of the h→WW* channel
* My group contributed to the h→WW* observation (6.1&sigma;) [PRD 92 (2015) 012006](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2641), providing the most precise single-channel measurement of Higgs boson couplings. My former graduate student Philip Chang (now a postdoc at UCSD) received the 2014 US ATLAS Graduate Student Achievement Award for his work on the h→WW* observation and the Higgs boson couplings measurements.
