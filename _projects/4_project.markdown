Two of the most intriguing mysteries of nature are <i>electroweak symmetry breaking</i> (EWSB) and the <i>origin of fundamental particle mass</i>. In the SM, the weak and electromagnetic forces have the same strength at very high energy (e.g. as existed in the very early Universe) described by single <i>electroweak</i> interaction and particles must be massless to preserve <i>gauge invariance</i> in which different configurations of the fields lead to identical physics results. Gauge invariance is a required ingredient of any quantum field theory describing Nature, otherwise calculated values of physically measurable quantities (e.g. the probability of two W bosons scattering at high energy) can be infinite. Since we know through observation that the electromagnetic force is much stronger than the weak force, electroweak symmetry is a broken symmetry. We also know that most fundamental particles have mass. Harder to answer in detail are the following questions: “<i>What is the agent of EWSB</i>?” and “<i>What is the origin of particle masses</i>?” The pursuit of answers to these questions and the search for new physics beyond the SM, especially novel use of the Higgs boson as a new tool in these searches, are primary thrusts of my current research.

The SM provides a mechanism, adopted from work in condensed matter theory and following Occam’s Razor logic, for electroweak symmetry breaking and generating masses of fundamental particles without violating gauge invariance. Particle masses arise when the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken by the interaction of massless fields with the “Higgs field” an invisible spinless field that permeates all space and has a non-zero value everywhere, even in its lowest energy state. If the SM description of EWSB is correct, then a <i>single massive, neutral, spinless</i> particle called the “Higgs boson” <i>must exist</i>.

In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments announced the discovery of a Higgs boson <i>h</i>. This discovery lead to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for a theoretical prediction of the Higgs boson. My group contributed to the Higgs boson discovery (5.9&sigma;) [PLB 716 (2012) 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7214) through analysis of the h→WW* channel.

My group contributed to the h→WW* observation (6.1&sigma;) [PRD 92 (2015) 012006](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2641), providing the most precise single-channel measurement of Higgs boson couplings. My former graduate student Philip Chang (now a postdoc at UCSD) received the 2014 US ATLAS Graduate Student Achievement Award for his work on the h→WW* observation and the Higgs boson couplings measurements.
