<i>Measurement of the &Lambda;</i>

<h3><span style="color:blue">Synopsis</span></h3>

On CDF, I lead an analysis of (b) in exclusive decay b →J/. At the time of publication [PRL 98 (2007) 122001], this was the single most precise measurement
of (b) and higher than the previous world average by 3.2. Our measurement resolved the “b Lifetime Puzzle” in favor of earlier theory calculations of (b).
