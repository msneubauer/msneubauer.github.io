<h3><span style="color:blue">Synopsis</span></h3>

The Solar Neutrino Problem refers to the large deficit of solar neutrinos observed on earth relative to the predictions from solar models and particle physics. It has been known since the 1960's that only about 1/3 of the predicted flux of solar electron neutrinos with energy above a few MeV (from a fusion chain involving <sup>8</sup>B) is observed on earth.

My analysis of 169.3 live-days of data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) <sup>8</sup>B provided first direct evidence for electron neutrino flavor change, resolving the decades-long Solar Neutrino Problem in the form of neutrino mass and mixing. The analysis presented in the first SNO paper [PRL 87 (2001) 71301](https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0106015) was based on my thesis work, although many scientists collaborated to design, build and commission the SNO detector and collect and analyze data from the experiment.

This result lead [2015 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/index.html) (A. McDonald, shared with T. Kajita) for observation of v<sub>e</sub> flavor change at SNO and to the [2016 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics](https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/L151).
