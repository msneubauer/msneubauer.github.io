<p>We all know that the Sun’s warming presence sustains life on Earth, but how many of us really take time to think about our Sun? Maybe in the morning when it takes us from a deep sleep into a disgruntled stupor? Or possibly for a fleeting moment when we put on our sunglasses? We almost certainly forget about it at night when the Earth shields us from all but the Sun’s pull of gravity, right? Not quite. We may not get sunburn at night, but you can be assured that the Sun is still shining on you. No, this is not just the sort of motivational malarkey you find inside a fortune cookie. As a by-product of the energy-generating nuclear fusion processes occurring deep inside the Sun, a very large number of ghostly particles having no electric charge and little mass called “neutrinos” whiz through your body - both day <span><em>and</em></span> night. You should not lose any sleep over this tonight - more than 60 billion solar neutrinos pass harmlessly through each square centimeter of your body every second without you ever noticing. These timid particles also pass straight through the entire Earth (unlike sunlight which gets absorbed) due to the fact the neutrinos are only very weakly interacting with matter. Because they are so difficult to detect, neutrinos are one of the most poorly understood of the fundamental particles in Nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this weakly interacting property affords researchers an opportunity to use neutrinos to probe the deep interior of stars. This is because neutrinos produced deep inside the Sun can propagate directly to the Earth, while photons, the particles of sunlight, bounce around for thousands of years after being created in the solar core before leaving the solar surface. This is just what Dr. John Bahcall, now at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and Dr. Raymond Davis Jr. of Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Pennsylvania had in mind in 1964 when they published two articles in <span><em>Physical Review Letters</em></span> proposing the use of a large underground chlorine detector to observe neutrinos which “can enable us to see into the interior of a star and thus verify...nuclear energy generation in stars.” The pioneering chlorine experiment mentioned in their papers came to a rather striking conclusion - only about 30% of the predicted number of solar neutrinos are reaching the Earth!</p>
<p>Physicists are skeptical people by nature. Few thought that this discrepancy had anything fundamental to do with the properties of elementary particles like neutrinos. Instead, the models of the Sun used to calculate the expected solar neutrino flux (the number of particles per unit area per unit time reaching Earth) were called into question. After all, calculating detailed, accurate properties of astrophysical systems is notoriously difficult. However, as solar model calculations were refined and other solar neutrino experiments using very different methods confirmed the results, people began taking the neutrino flux deficit - the “Solar Neutrino Problem” as it would become known - very seriously. Scientists now began asking the tantalizing question, “what are solar neutrinos telling us about <span><em>particle physics</em></span>?” rather than “what are solar neutrinos telling us about our lack of understanding of how the Sun works?”</p>
<p>Neutrinos are known to exist in three different types or “flavors” - electron-type (), muon-type (), and tau-type () which characterize the type of heavy, charged particle - electron, muon, and tau - with which they associate. Only electron-type neutrinos are generated by the Sun, so previous solar neutrino experiments were primarily sensitive to this type of neutrino. In an attempt to explain the results from these experiments, theories developed over the years that describe the deficit as resulting from transformations or “mixing” between massive neutrino species. This is referred to as “neutrino oscillation” because the neutrino species appear to change back and forth into one another in a wave-like manner as they propagate though space. The chance of seeing a given neutrino type depends on where in the wave you happen to be looking. In this way, electron neutrinos generated in the Sun could be seen as changing into other neutrinos (and/or ) when their wave washes up on Earth. Since previous experiments have had little or no sensitivity to neutrinos other than , this neutrino flavor change is interpreted as a solar neutrino deficit. Neutrinos are incorporated as massless particles into our current best theory of fundamental particles and their interactions, the “Standard Model”. Therefore, observation of solar neutrino oscillation requiring neutrino mass and mixing would constitute a window into exciting new physics.</p>
<p>There are several signatures of neutrino oscillation which can be observed with the properly designed experiment. An experiment able to separately measure the total flux of all neutrinos (+ + ) and the -only flux could directly observe electron neutrino flavor change into other flavors. Some oscillation scenarios also predict a significant deviation of neutrino energies observed at the Earth from those known to be generated in the Sun by standard nuclear fusion processes. Neutrino oscillation can also cause the solar neutrino rate measured in a given experiment to depend on the time of day (e.g. different day/night rates) or the time of the year (e.g. different summer/winter rates), after correcting for known effects related to the Earth’s motion around the Sun.</p>
<p>The importance of an experiment capable of making separate flavor-specific and neutrino flavor-independent measurements of the solar neutrino flux in directly solving the Solar Neutrino Problem was stressed in 1985 by the late Professor Herb Chen of the University of California at Irvine. He further pointed out that heavy water () could be used for such an experiment, provided stringent purity requirements inherent to the use could be achieved. Compared to the hydrogen nuclei in normal water (), heavy water contains additional loosely bound neutrons that make an excellent target for solar neutrino detection. The dream of a heavy water solar neutrino detector was finally realized with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) after more than a decade of construction by physicists and engineers at institutions throughout United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The SNO detector is located inside a large (22 m <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo>×</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\times</annotation></semantics></math> 30 m) cavity 6800 ft underground in the INCO, Ltd Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is designed to study solar neutrinos with the principal purpose of understanding the origin of the Solar Neutrino Problem. Using SNO, one is able to study neutrinos from a rare but high energy (hence easier to detect) component of the solar neutrino flux referred to as neutrinos, named after the parent nucleus from which they are produced. Neutrinos are primarily detected in SNO through their interactions with 1000 tons of heavy water contained in a 12 m diameter acrylic vessel. The vessel is surrounded by <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∼</mo><mn>9500</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sim 9500</annotation></semantics></math> sensitive light detectors called photomultiplier tubes (or PMTs) mounted on a 17 m diameter geodesic support structure. These PMTs collect Cherenkov light generated by the fast-moving charged particles resulting from neutrino interactions inside the detector. The remaining detector volume is filled with ultra-pure acting as a shield against naturally occurring radioactivity from the cavity walls and detector materials. Because intrinsic radioactivity can produce Cherenkov light that is a background to our solar neutrino signals of interest, the entire laboratory must be operated as a clean room - a real challenge in the dirty environment of a nickel mine located 2 km underground.</p>
<p>Solar neutrinos primarily interact with heavy water in two ways - the “charged-current” (CC) reaction which only occurs for electron neutrinos and the “neutral-current” (NC) reaction which has the same rate independent of neutrino flavor. Comparison of the CC and NC rates (corrected for differences in neutrino interaction probability, signal acceptance, etc.) provides a direct measure of flavor change into + (denoted ). If the CC rate is less than the NC rate, then solar ’s are changing into other flavors <span><em>en route</em></span> to Earth. If, in addition, the NC rate also agrees with total flux predicted by solar model calculations, we can consider the Solar Neutrino Problem most simply explained by <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo accent="false">→</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math>flavor transformations.</p>
<p>SNO can also detect neutrinos which scatter elastically from atomic electrons in the water, much like a cue ball striking another billiard ball. This “elastic scattering” (ES) has both CC (only) and NC (neutrino flavor independent) components. For this reason, the ES occurs at a rate approximately six times greater for than for or . The ES reaction is not specific to heavy water - it occurs throughout both the and regions of the SNO detector. It is also the primary method of solar neutrino detection in light water () experiments, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande. This gives these experiments weak neutral-current sensitivity without requiring expensive heavy water - a sort of “poor man’s NC.”</p>
<p>I set out in my doctoral thesis to solve the Solar Neutrino Problem using SNO data collected over a period of 14 months beginning in November 1999. My strategy was to first confirm that there really is a Solar Neutrino Problem by measuring the flux via the CC reaction and then to compare my measurement of the CC and ES rates to look for possible neutrino flavor change behind the solar deficit. If the flux determined from the measured CC rate is smaller than that inferred from the ES rate (assuming no flavor transformation), then one has observed solar <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mo accent="false">→</mo><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math>change.</p>
<p>In order to make these CC and ES measurements, one needs a model of how the detector responds to solar neutrinos. The model includes how much Cherenkov light is generated by energetic charged particles produced in solar neutrino interactions (directly related to the energy of those charged particles), the location and direction of the generated light, how much of that light is absorbed and scattered before being detected by the PMTs (i.e. detector optics), and how the instrumentation responds to Cherenkov light incident onto the PMTs. The validity of the model is tested as thoroughly as possible using calibration sources of energetic charged particles providing known energies and locations inside the detector. One then uses this model to extract the CC and ES signal rates from data after backgrounds have been removed and the position/direction of charged particles in the data sample have been estimated. The CC and ES rates are corrected for the fraction of each signal retained in the full analysis using the model. The rates are then compared to solar model expectations.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many pieces of analysis which need to be stitched together to implement such a strategy. In the case of my thesis, there were also significant challenges along the way that required unique solutions to be pursued and implemented. The detector optics that directly affect energy response were not completely calibrated when I performed my analysis, so I developed analysis techniques which explicitly used calibration data to reduce sensitivity to optical model uncertainties. The success of this approach proved critical to the accuracy of my results as energy scale (i.e. the number of PMT hits per unit of charged particle energy) is the largest systematic uncertainty on my measurements. Another serious hurdle in my solar neutrino analysis was backgrounds in the high energy region where neutrinos are to be found. It was discovered even before we put water in the detector that spontaneous emission of light from our PMTs was swamping our solar neutrino signal by more than two orders of magnitude under steady-state conditions (frequent bursts were worse yet). My early analysis on this light emission was important for devising ways to remove these backgrounds and resulted in two rejection algorithms used in first-pass filtering of the SNO production data stream.</p>
<p>Reconstructing the position and direction of energetic charged particles in SNO from the PMT information is an important part of the analysis because many solar neutrino backgrounds can only be removed from the data sample by locating them outside of the region. Because I felt that event reconstruction was an area where much improvement could be made in SNO, I developed a new reconstruction algorithm which was chosen as the primary event reconstruction method used in SNO analyses.</p>
<p>With the key analysis pieces in place, I was able to extract CC and ES solar neutrino signals from the data and estimate my errors on the measured rates. I measured the CC rate to be 35% of the solar model prediction, confirming that the solar deficit is also seen using SNO. My measured ES rate is 50% of the predicted rate assuming no neutrino flavor change, higher than the CC rate by two standard deviations. Although the higher ES rate is what one would expect if ’s were transforming into other neutrino flavors, the statistics on the SNO ES signal for my data set is too to low to conclude this with high confidence. The Super-Kamiokande experiment has made measurements of the <span><em>same</em></span> solar neutrinos using neutrino-electron elastic scattering with much higher statistics than is currently available in SNO. Using their published ES results, I find that the flux inferred from the ES rate is larger than the CC rate by 3.5 standard deviations. My measurements provide evidence for solar neutrino flavor change at greater than 99.98% confidence. This conclusion is summed up in the title of my thesis - <span><em>Evidence for Electron Neutrino Flavor Change Through Measurement of the Solar Neutrino Flux at SNO</em></span>.</p>
<p>Since the sensitivity of the ES rate to and is known (it is about six times smaller than ), one can calculate the total neutrino flux from the measured CC and ES rates. Performing this calculation, I find that the total flux is in perfect agreement with the solar model predictions! “I feel like dancing,” said Dr. Bahcall [June 19, 2001 NYTimes article] after the first SNO results confirmed his solar model calculations. As a result, we now know that  2/3 of all electron neutrinos change flavor into and/or before reaching the Earth. The Solar Neutrino Problem has been solved - the missing neutrinos were there the whole time, we just needed to know how to look. In fact, the light water solar neutrino experiments had been detecting these missing neutrino all along, but there was just no way for them to know!</p>
<p>In summary, the primary results of my thesis are a demonstration neutrino flavor change and a measurement of the tolar solar neutrino flux. For the first time ever, the Sun can be consider a calibrated neutrino source! This provides a resolution of the Solar Neutrino Problem, but what does it mean for particle physics? While there are many theories describing neutrino flavor change, neutrino oscillation appears to be the most natural and therefore plausible explanation. This thesis now represents the second strong indication of neutrino oscillation and neutrino mass, with the other being interpretation of Kamiokande and SuperKamiokande data on neutrinos produced in the atmosphere. While neutrinos are assumed massless in the Standard Model and therefore these results provide evidence for physics beyond it, many extensions to the Standard model are able to naturally accommodate massive neutrinos. Even so, it is clear that there are still many questions to be answered. One particularly striking observation is the <span><em>way</em></span> neutrinos mix with one another. Within the Standard Model, other much more massive particles called “quarks” comprising nuclear matter have been known to mix with each other for quite some time now. However, the intrinsic mixing between quarks is far smaller than that of the neutrinos, where the mixing is large (the latter for solar neutrinos is now known with the addition of SNO results). It is as if Nature has two different blender settings - Stir/Chop for quarks and Puree/Liquefy for neutrinos. The question then becomes, “are they both in the same kind of blender?” That is, in what ways are neutrino mixing and quark mixing similar and are there unifying principles relating the two at work? Is there a reason why neutrino masses are so tiny compared to other particles? Is neutrino matter and antimatter the same? Further information from SNO and future experiments will constrain the allowed parameter space for neutrino oscillations to narrow down which, if any, of the new theories are realized in Nature.</p>
<p>As a historical aside, I began working on the SNO experiment under direction of Professor Eugene Beier in the summer before my first year of graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1994. Because this was roughly five years before the start of data taking, I was able to become heavily involved in the SNO detector building and commissioning as well as early analysis of the data. By the time I completed my doctoral thesis in June 2001, I had made significant contributions at nearly all stages of the experiment - from detector simulation, design, construction, and commissioning, to a complete analysis leading to a major publication. It is my impression that very few graduate students in recent times get this type of experience on a particle physics experiment with the same level of scientific impact as SNO.</p>
