I am a professor and particle physicist at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu). I am also affiliated faculty with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) located on the University of Illinois campus. Generally speaking, my research aims to understand the universe at its most fundamental level, including the constituents of matter and their interactions.

My current research is focused on searching for physics beyond the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) through detailed study of high-energy proton-proton collisions at [CERN](https://home.cern)'s [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider). In this pursuit, my [research group](https://msneubauer.github.io/NeubauerGroup/team) analyzes data from the [ATLAS Experiment](http://atlasexperiment.org), with an emphasis on the <span style="color:blue">Higgs boson</span> as a <span style="color:blue">sensitive tool</span> to search for <span style="color:blue">new physics</span> and applications of <span style="color:blue">machine learning</span> to improve the sensitivity for these searches.

My group is also working to improve the experimental methods and apparatus in high-energy physics, including <span style="color:blue">advancing scientific software</span> and <span style="color:blue">computing</span> and developing <span style="color:blue">fast electronics</span> for <span style="color:blue">highly-parallelized</span> systems that <span style="color:blue">track charged particles</span> at the LHC.

<b>See my [Research page](research)</b> for some of my past research highlights and [Neubauer Group](https://msneubauer.github.io/NeubauerGroup) for more information about my current research in particle physics.

I am also passionate about STEM education and outreach, especially creative use of modern technology in electronics, computing and data science in education. See my [Teaching page](teaching) for more information!
