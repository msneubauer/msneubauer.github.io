I am a professor and particle physicist at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu). I am also affiliated faculty with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) and the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu). Generally speaking, my research aims to understand the universe at its most fundamental level, including the constituents of matter and their interactions.

My current research is to search for physics beyond the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) through a detailed study of high-energy proton-proton collisions at [CERN](https://home.cern)'s [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider). My [research group](https://neubauer-group.github.io/team) searches for new physics using data from the [ATLAS Experiment](http://atlasexperiment.org), with an emphasis on the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) as a sensitive new tool and applications of <span style="color:blue">machine learning</span> to enhance our sensitivity.

My group is also working to improve the experimental methods and apparatus in high-energy physics, including <span style="color:blue">advancing scientific software</span> and <span style="color:blue">computing</span> and developing <span style="color:blue">fast electronics</span> for <span style="color:blue">highly-parallelized</span> systems that <span style="color:blue">track charged particles</span> at the LHC.

<b>See my [Research page](research)</b> for some of my past research highlights and the [Neubauer Group](https://neubauer-group.github.io) for more information about my current research in particle physics.

I am also passionate about outreach and education in STEM fields, especially the creative use of technologies from data science to improve physics education. See my [Teaching page](teaching) for more information!
